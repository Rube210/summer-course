# Hands-On: Python Conditional Statements - Solutions

These exercises focus on using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow. You'll work with comparison operators, logical operators, and data types from Lesson 1 to make decisions in your code.

---

## Hands-On #1:

---

### Exercise 1: Check if a Number is Positive

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for an integer number, and then checks if the number is positive using an `if` statement.

```python
number = int(input("What number would you like to check?  "))

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "The number is positive" if the number is greater than 0.

---

### Exercise 2: Even or Odd

**Goal**: Write a Python script that asks a user for an integer number.  Check if the number is even or odd using `if` and `else`.

```python
number = int(input("Enter an integer:  "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "Even" or "Odd" based on the number.

---

### Exercise 3: Age Category

**Goal**: Write a python script that asks a user for their age, and then uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to print the correct category for the person by based on their age.

```python
age = int(input("How old are you?  "))

if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age <= 19:

second_number = float(input("What is the second number?  "))

if first_number > second_number:
    print(first_number, "is larger")
elif b > a:
    print(second_number, "is larger")
else:
    print("The numbers are equal")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "a is larger", "b is larger", or "a and b are equal".

---

### Exercise 5: Grade Converter

    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")

if len(text) > 10:
    print("Long string")

```python
number = float(input("Enter a number:  "))

if number >= 10 and number <= 20:
    print("Number is in range")
else:
    print("Out of range")

if letter == "a" or letter == "e" or letter == "i" or letter == "o" or letter == "u":
    print("Vowel")
else:
